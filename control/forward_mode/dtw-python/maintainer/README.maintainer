The roxygen2 api changed. Also, some examples needed manual tweaking anyway.



The roxypick script

 - extract roxygen2 strings
 - writes examples in examples/*.R
 - writes also in examples/*.py.draft after minor conversions
 - puts sections (converted in rst) in-place in the python files, at RIMPORT
 - adds an example section from examples/*.py.txt , if found
